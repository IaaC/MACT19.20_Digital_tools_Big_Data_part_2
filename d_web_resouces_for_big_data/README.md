## Turning geodata into stories

This folder contains some examples for visualising geospatial data using web libraries. There are mainly two types of visualization:

* [Cartograms](cartograms) or maps with modified geometries to stress out indicator values.
* [Web maps](web_mapping) or web applications dealing with geospatial information taken from mayor providers.
