# Structured data sources
## Databases and postgreSQL + postgis
Spatial databases are supported by main database systems. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) allows to create databases storing both spatial and non-spatial data sets.
To store geospatial data the extension [Postgis](https://postgis.net/) has to be installed.

In this folder you can find the following resources:

* A database dump to be restored in a PostgreSQL server (Version 10 or superior)
* A set of [queries](query_examples.sql) (written in SQL) to test out the basic features of this query language.
* A set of [commands](configuration_examples.sql) to manually configurate the database environment if needed.
